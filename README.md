# Binary-Search-Tree
A binary search tree class and account database program that implements it.

These programs were developed collaboratively with a fellow student as an academic project. show9.cpp, test9.cpp, and accounts.dat were provided by the instructor.

Description of files:
BSTree.cpp and BSTree.h contain the binary search tree class.
test9.cpp allows the user to interact with an instance of the binary search tree class.
show9.cpp visualizes the tree users are working with.
database.cpp loads fictional account balances from accounts.dat into a binary search tree and allows users to look up accounts.
